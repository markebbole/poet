slipping as slowly as possible
primes swirl to a singularity
fake fortunes guarantee soulful predictions
lucky ones tell all lies
meandering as forever dwindled on
dark druids gazing manicured slippers
aged and interested so, joining sullied mander
lucid gates, found not one slander
mounted after moonshine space flippers
clams cackle into licensed fear
singing out "silence" in lear
slices after salient space
to address these afflictions
