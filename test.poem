slipping as slowly as possible
primes swirl to a singularity
fake fortunes guarantee soulful predictions
lucky ones tell all lies
meandering as forever dwindled on
dark druids gazing manicured slippers
aged and interested so, joining sullied mender
lucid gates, found not one slender
mounted after moonshine space, tippers
clams cackle into licensed fear
singing out "silence" in lear
slices after silent space
destroy these addictions
